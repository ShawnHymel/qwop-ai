# QWOP AI

This Jupyter Notebook uses Stable Baselines and Gymnasium to train a reinforcement learning AI agent to play the game [qwop](https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html). Open the [notebook](qwop-ai.ipynb) and execute the cells to follow along. 

> Read the comments in the cells! You may need to make slight changes to the code to get everything to work.

If you just want to run the trained model, I recommend checking out the [v07 tagged branch](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/qwop-ai/releases/tag/v07), as that seems to work the best. Execute the cells up to training. Skip the training step, and simply load *qwop_model_v07.zip* to test my trained model.
